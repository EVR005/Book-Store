This is a MERN STACK project which runs on localhost server, which I undertook for my advances in databases course. Almost all the features of MongoDB,
starting from basic CRUD Operations
to Complex Aggregation Pipeline Queries have been demonstrated in my project.

Steps to run the project:
1.) Make sure Node and MongoDB is installed in your device, beforehand
2.) Download the zip file and extract the contents
3.) Open the server folder in terminal and run "npm i"
4.) Do the same by opening client folder in terminal
#installs the dependencies specified in package.json
5.) now in both the terminals run "npm start"

Database creation:
1.) In order for the MongoDB connection to work, change the url to your database connection url, in server/config/default.json
